A color scheme with good contrast, yet easy on the eyes.
Looks the same in the GUI as it does on a 16 color terminal.
Uses the Tango color palette (http://tango.freedesktop.org).

Terminal users:
Intended for display on a black (#000000) background with a text color
of #d3d7cf. Also make sure your terminal is using the Tango color 
palette. GNOME Terminal uses it by default. Linux console users, see

Also make sure that background=dark in vim.
